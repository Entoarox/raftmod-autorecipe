# AutoRecipe
Enables recipes to prepare themselves, no more scrolling through your inventory to find the right ingredients!  
Check it out on [RaftModding](https://www.raftmodding.com/mods/autorecipe)

## Usage
Put down a cooking pot, and place some recipes near it, preferably on the cooking pot's included board.  
Interact with the recipes to prepare them and start cooking them.

## What does it (not) do?
This is a quality of life mod, it does not alter or cheat the original gameplay:
* You still need all the ingredients in your inventory
* The cooking pot must be empty and have fuel.  
* The recipes can only prepare a cooking pot that is in close proximity.
